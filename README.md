Jekko is an AdonisJS Helper Package which helps you mark currently active items in your navigation.

It takes inspiration from the [Ekko](https://github.com/laravelista/Ekko) package for Laravel hence Jekko.

## Installation

From the command line:

```bash
npm install --save poowf/jekko
```

You will need to include the service provider in start/app.js

```javascript
const providers = [
  ...,
  '@poowf/jekko/providers/JekkoProvider'
]
```

And also include it in the globalMiddleware in start/kernel.js

```javascript
const globalMiddleware = [
  ...,
  'Poowf/Middleware/Jekko'
]
```

## Overview

To mark a menu item active in [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar), you need to add a `active` CSS class to the `<li>` tag:

```html
<ul class="nav navbar-nav">
    <li class="active"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
</ul>
```

With Jekko your code will look like this:

```html
<ul class="nav navbar-nav">
    <li class="{{ isActiveURL('/') }}"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
</ul>
```

What if you are not using Bootstrap, but some other framework or a custom design? Instead of returning `active` CSS class, you can make Ekko return any string you want:

```html
<ul class="nav navbar-nav">
    <li class="{{ isActiveURL('/', 'highlight') }}"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
</ul>
```

You can also use it in templating if you need to display some content depending on which page you are in your layout view:

```html
@if(isActiveRoute('home') != '')
    <p>Something that is only visible on the `home` route.</p>
@endif
```

## API

### isActiveRoute

Compares given route name with current route name.

```javascript
isActiveRoute($routeName, $output = "active")
```

**Examples:**

If the current route is `home`, function `isActiveRoute('home')` would return *string* `active`.

_The `*` wildcard can be used for resource routes_

Function `isActiveRoute('user.*')` would return string `active` for any current route which begins with `user`.

### isActiveURL

Compares given URL path with current URL path.

```javascript
isActiveURL($url, $output = "active")
```

**Examples:**

If the current URL path is `/about`, function `isActiveURL('/about')` would return *string* `active`.

### isActiveMatch

Detects if the given string is found in the current URL.

```javascript
isActiveMatch($string, $output = "active")
```

**Examples:**

If the current URL path is `/about` or `/insideout`, function `isActiveMatch('out')` would return *string* `active`.

### areActiveRoutes

Compares given array of route names with current route name.

```javascript
areActiveRoutes(array $routeNames, $output = "active")
```

**Examples:**

If the current route is `product.index` or `product.show`, function `areActiveRoutes(['product.index', 'product.show'])` would return *string* `active`.

_The `*` wildcard can be used for resource routes_

Function `areActiveRoutes(['user.*', 'product.*'])` would return string `active` for any current route which begins with `user` or `product`.

### areActiveURLs

Compares given array of URL paths with current URL path.

```javascript
areActiveURLs(array $urls, $output = "active")
```

**Examples:**

If the current URL path is `/product` or `/product/create`, function `areActiveURLs(['/product', '/product/create'])` would return *string* `active`.
